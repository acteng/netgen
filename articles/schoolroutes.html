</h2>
<p>This outlines the methods and preliminary findings of the
SchoolRoutes project. See the <a href="https://departmentfortransportuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ATE/Data%20%20Analysis/Digital/projects/atum/schoolroutes/Project%20Charter/project_charter_schoolroutes.docx?d=w27b2cd1af6d74e7fb789f5039f8286b0&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=LsZ7Mi" class="external-link">project
charter</a> for a full description of the project’s aims, objectives,
and scope.</p>
<p>There is a large and growing body of evidence on the relationships
between active travel, physical activity, and positive environmental,
economic, social and health outcomes. Research supporting the Propensity
to Cycle Tool (PCT) project, based on 2010/2011 English travel to school
data, with the number of trips by mode at the origin-destination level,
for example found that there was substantial unmet potential for cycling
to school. Based on data from The Netherlands and considering English
trip distances and hills, a 22-fold increase was found to be possible
under the Go Dutch scenario, associated with a 57% increase in physical
activity for pupils at state run primary and secondary schools <span class="citation">Goodman et al. (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>While the PCT — and associated website which provides data downloads
and evidence in a map-based web application hosted at <a href="https://www.pct.bike" class="external-link">www.pct.bike</a> — has been widely used by
local authorities and other stakeholders, there are several reasons to
revisit the issue of mode shift potential for travel to school, and the
specific question of active travel potential, now:</p>
<ul>
<li>School catchments and travel patterns have changed substantially
since the 2010/2011 data on which <span class="citation">Goodman et al.
(2019)</span> was based. More recent travel data can overcome a major
limitation of that study by presenting current transport patterns to
school.</li>
<li>The travel to school layer in the PCT described by <span class="citation">Goodman et al. (2019)</span> provided only a single
metric for segments on the road network: cycling potential (under a
range of scenarios), without reference to key infrastructure datasets
that could be vital when prioritising local interventions and
identifying where ‘pinch points’ are in the network.</li>
<li>The pandemic and subsequent restrictions on have been linked with <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMooreLab/status/1492883858450169857" class="external-link">alarming
increase in childhood obesity rates and inequalities</a>, as shown in
Figure 1. This has pushed active travel for kids up the political
agenda.</li>
<li>The travel to school layer in the original PCT resulted in a sparse
network in some places. This can be overcome using new methods for
disaggregating OD pairs to show diffuse residential networks <span class="citation">(Lovelace, Félix, and Carlino 2022)</span>.</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, evidence presented in the PCT omitted the
potential for walking to school, which is likely to be more important
for shorter trips and for younger children, especially in the near
term.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the policy side, and as part of the UK Government’s Health
Mission, health and wellbeing for young people has risen up the
political agenda. ‘School Streets’ interventions featured prominently in
all rounds of the Active Travel Fund (ATF) bids, yet there is a lack of
evidence to support safe routes to school and where they should be
located. More broadly, strategic active travel networks have already
largely been designed, as part of the LCWIP process, while
cost-effective interventions that fix ‘weak links’ in quiet/beginner
networks have received less attention.</p>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>As outlined in the project charter, the project aims to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Generate estimates of active travel potential for school travel,
based on separate uptake functions for walking and cycling.</p></li>
<li><p>Use ‘jittering’, described in an academic paper (Lovelace et
al. 2022), to create a realistic distribution of school route starting
points within LSOAs, generating dense networks connecting residential
origins with schools.</p></li>
<li><p>Use 2023 origin-destination data from DfE, describing the number
of children from each English LSOA travelling to each school in
England.</p></li>
<li><p>Update cycling and walking uptake scenarios to reflect ATE
targets and long-term aspirations.</p></li>
<li><p>Include route segment information on cycle friendliness and
traffic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, the project will provide a basis for modelling active
travel that can be applied to other trip purposes, as part of the Active
Travel Uptake Model (ATUM) project in 2023. ATUM aims to replace the
PCT, building on the Network Planning Tool for Scotland (<a href="https://npt.scot/" class="external-link">NPT</a>).</p>

<h2 id="data-and-methods">Data and methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-and-methods"></a>
</h2>
<p>The approach outlined in this paper uses the following datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Origin-destination (OD) data on travel to school from the Department
for Education (DfE) from Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) to schools
(non-sensitive simulated OD datasets are used in the open access version
of this paper).</li>
<li>Data on state-run schools, including their locations, type
(primarily primary, secondary), and other characteristics, from the Get
Information about Schools (GIAS) service.</li>
<li>OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for the road network, with value-added by
routing software such as <code>od2net</code> to pre-process the data and
generate route networks.</li>
<li>Elevation data, enabling hilliness to be factored into walking and
cycling potential estimates.</li>
<li>Datasets from the Modeshift Stars programme, which provides data on
the number of trips to school by mode for a sample of schools in England
(not currently used).</li>
</ul>
<p>A methodological limitation of the PCT approach was that it used only
zone centroids as trip origins, which can lead to a sparse ‘spider’s
web’ of routes that do not reflect the actual routes taken by children
to school, rather than the dense networks that are needed (see example
in the case study section below). To overcome this, the approach taken
in this paper is to disaggregate the OD data, modelling multiple origins
or ‘subpoints’ within each zone, to better represent the geographic
distribution of trips to school.</p>
<p>For each OD pair, the number of trips that could be walked or cycled
is estimated based on route characteristics. For walking, the proportion
of trips that can be walked
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>p</mi><mtext mathvariant="normal">walk</mtext></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_{\text{walk}}</annotation></semantics></math>)
is modelled as a simple exponential decay function of distance, with
parameters specifying the rate of decay (the exponent) and the maximum
proportion of trips that can be walked, building on work by <span class="citation">(Iacono, Krizek, and El-Geneidy 2010)</span>:</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>For cycling, the proportion of trips that can be cycled is based on
the Go Dutch scenario in the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) project
<span class="citation">(Goodman et al. 2019)</span>. These uptake
functions are illustrated in the figures below.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>The figures above show that the proportion of trips made by walking
and cycling for each OD pair depends on a function of distance for
walking, and a function of the trip distance and hilliness for cycling.
It is important to apply these function to the <em>route</em> distance
and hilliness rather than the Euclidean distance, as the actual distance
travelled can be much longer than the Euclidean distance, especially in
areas with complex road networks or hilly terrain. After calculating the
proportion of trips walked or cycled per route, the proportion is
multiplied by the estimated <em>total</em> number of trips by <em>all
modes</em> to estimate the number of trips that could be walked or
cycled along each route. The route-level counts are then aggregated in a
process that can be referred to as “travel flow aggregation” <span class="citation">(Morgan and Lovelace 2020)</span>.</p>

<!-- The following case study demonstrates how the approach works in practice, using the city of York as an example. -->
<!-- The following code was used to prepare the data with the `od2net` R package (see the paper's [source code](https://github.com/acteng/netgen/blob/main/vignettes/schoolroutes.Rmd) for full reproducible details): -->
<!-- We'll save the OD dataset in the required format: -->
<!-- After saving necessary files in the `input` folder, as required by the `od2net` Rust crate, a 'config file' is required to run the model. -->
<!-- We used the following configuration options for this case study: -->
<!-- The `od2net` package requires a configuration file to run. We will use the following configuration file: -->
<!-- If the previous lines of code run successfully and you have `od2net` installed, the route network dataset can be generated with the following command, which generates the following message: -->
<!-- The `od2net` program generates the following files and places them in the `output` folder: -->
<!-- -   `output.geojson`: the route network dataset.
-   `rnet.pmtiles`: a compressed version of the route network dataset for interactive visualisation in web apps.
-   `counts.csv`: a CSV file with the counts of trips on each route segment.
-   `od.csv`: summary statistics with the total number of trips estimated for each OD pair.
-   `failed_requests.geojson`: a geojson file with the failed requests (i.e. those that could not be routed). -->
<!-- The most relevant of these is the 'output.geojson' file, which is also provided as a compressed `pmtiles` file. -->
<!-- You can visualise the results in the web app hosted at [od2net.org](https://od2net.org) by uploading the `output.pmtiles` file, resulting in an interactive map of the routes, as shown in the Figure below. -->
<!-- @ref(fig:od2net). -->
<p>The approach uses the od2net tool, developed by Dustin Carlino on
secondment to ATE from the Alan Turing Institute. The raw outputs can be
visualised in the web app hosted at <a href="https://od2net.org" class="external-link">od2net.org</a>, resulting in an interactive
map of the routes, as shown in the Figure below. The od2net web
application is useful for gaining a quick insight into the results, but
is rather unrefined and not adapted to the needs of transport planning.
This suggests a need for presenting the results in an alternative way,
for example in the Scheme Browser tool hosted at

<p>A useful feature of the route network level data outputs is that the

<p>Of the output variables provided at the segment, presented in the
figure above, the level the most relevant are:
<!-- `count`, `lts`, `osm_tags`, and `way`. --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>count</code>: the number of trips on each route segment.</li>
<li>
<code>lts</code>: the level of traffic stress (LTS) on each route
segment.</li>
<li>
<code>osm_tags</code>: the OpenStreetMap tags for each route
segment, for example surface quality, whether or not the segment is lit,
and the maximum speed limit (the quality/coverage of these tags varies
by region depending on the OSM community).</li>
<li>
<code>way</code>: the unique identifier for each route segment,
which can be used to link to other datasets and to OSM, enabling people
to view and update the data.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Let's take a look at these for a sample of 3 rows --><p><!-- (see Table @ref(tab:rnet-sample)): -->
<!-- (see Table below): --></p>

<!-- Let's create a minimal version of the dataset for future plots: -->
<p>The output dataset can be visualised with well-known data science
tools, as illustrated in the figure below. The figure shows the routes

uptake scenario (left), which represents a doubling in the number of
trips made by cycling to school <span class="citation">(Goodman et al.

<p>The same approach can be used to estimate walking to school
potential, based on the all-mode flows to school contained in the OD
data. The results for walking and cycling surrounding Stratford Way are
shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>Note that the results for walking show that the number of trips is
generally higher than for cycling close to the school, but as you move
further away, the relative number of cycling trips increases. This
highlights the fact that cycle networks around schools need to be longer
than walking networks.</p>

<p>A simple way to prioritise investment based on the route network
outputs shown above is to find the LTS3 and LTS4 roads with the greatest
potential. A key output from the tool will be route network data that
contains both the potential number of trips and the LTS classification
of each road segment. Taking a hypothetical scenario in which there is
sufficient funding for investment in 5 school streets, targetting the
worst (LTS3 and LTS4) roads in York, the data allows us to identify the
roads presented in

<p>Combined with local knowledge and other sources of data, such as
information on road widths and traffic speeds and volumes, and
consultation with local residents and schools, the SchoolRoutes evidence
can be used to inform investment decisions. The results also help
prioritise from a list of schemes that are already in the pipeline, with
Huntingdon Road, for example, being highlighted as a key route for
investment in York according to the results.</p>

</h3>
<p>The results for the synthetic data were sense-checked by comparing
the total number of trips and distance travelled represented in the OD
dataset with the output of the model.</p>
<!-- The total Euclidean distance travelled according to the synthetic OD data is 49,271 km, with a weighted mean distance of 1,922.3 km. -->
<p>Assuming a ‘trip diversion factor’ (meaning the distance travelled on
the network compared with straight line distance) of 1.4 and that on
average 60% of the trips are made by cycling under the Go Dutch scenario
for the short distances travelled to school, we can estimate the total
number distance travelled by bike to school on a typical school day as
38,431 km. The equivalent for the route network output under the Go
Dutch scenario is 55,836 km. Note that the values presented above are
based on <em>synthetic</em> OD data, which may not be representative of
the actual travel patterns in York.</p>
<p>Let’s compare with the number who cycle under the less ambitious
Government Target scenario: The total distance travelled under the
Government Target scenario is 4,612 km. These numbers make sense and
align well with the peer-reviewed results of the Propensity to Cycle
Tool project, as shown in the figure below. A visual approach to quality
assurance is to compare the results with the Propensity to Cycle Tool
school travel outputs, which are available for York, as illustrated
below.</p>

<p>Note that while there are differences in the results, the
SchoolRoutes outputs presented above are based on synthetic OD data.
Despite this, both sets of results highlight the same roads, and the
results are on the same scale, which is a good sign that the
SchoolRoutes outputs are plausible. It is clear from the SchoolRoutes
outputs in the figure above (bottom), that the networks it generates are
much denser: most of the roads around the school are highlighted, rather
than just a few key routes in the PCT.</p>

the high computational efficiency of the <code>od2net</code> tool, which
resulted from the grant funding agreement allowing the Alan Turing
Institute to develop the tool, the approach can be applied to any local
authority in England, and potentially beyond, to estimate the potential
for active travel to school.</p>
<p>To deploy the project at scale there is a substantial amount of work
to do, including the following (with estimates in days of work):</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed quantitative comparison of results with Propensity to Cycle
Tool outputs (5-10 days)</li>
<li>Validating the results against ground truth data for a single local
authority (5 days)</li>
<li>Refining the parameters in the walking uptake (and potentially
cycling uptake) functions (5-30 days)</li>
<li>Integration of ModeShift Stars data and Census data to generate
better baseline data (10-30 days)</li>
<li>Inclusion of gradient data, gradient is not included in the walking
or cycling routes or uptake model currently (5-20 days)</li>
<li>Sense-checking results based on local knowledge with input from
inspectors and/or local authority staff and, optionally, collaborating
with partners to gain feedback and improve the approach based on that
feedback (5-30 days)</li>
<li>Running the tool for every local authority in England (10-20
days)</li>
<li>Development of front-end tools for visualising the results (5-50
days depending on level of sophistication)</li>
<li>Presenting results to stakeholders in workshops (5 days)</li>
<li>Writing case studies of how to use the tool in collaboration with
local authorities (10 days)</li>
<li>Training local authority staff to use the tool (5-20 days)</li>
<li>Integration into the browse tool in the <a href="https://github.com/acteng/atip" class="external-link"><code>atip</code></a> codebase,
(see <a href="https://plan.activetravelengland.gov.uk" class="external-link">plan.activetravelengland.gov.uk</a>)
(10 days)</li>
<li>Writing up the results in a peer-reviewed journal article (10
days)</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, the project would require around 100-250 days of work,
depending on the project’s ambition and scope. It may be worth chunking
the project into 2 distinct phases, e.g. a pilot for a handful of local
authorities (e.g. 20 days’ work), followed by a full rollout to all
local authorities in England. With the potential to have a substantial
impact on active travel to school in England, and to provide a
foundation for a next-generation strategic active travel network
planning tool going beyond the now-outdated Propensity to Cycle Tool,
the project is well worth pursuing.</p>
