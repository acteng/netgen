# Introduction


There is a large and growing body of evidence on modal split, physical activity, and the relationships between social/economic/policy/environmental factors and transport behaviour.
A recent study based on data from England explored cycling to school based on 2010/2011 origin-destination data, finding substantial unmet potential, with a 22-fold increase under the Go Dutch scenario associated with a 57% increase in physical activity for pupils at state run primary and secondary schools @goodman_scenarios_2019.
This raises the question: why revisit the issue of mode shift potential for travel to school, and the specific question of active travel potential, now?
Three broad factors make this is a timely topic:

-   School catchments and travel patterns have changed substantially since the 2010/2011 data on which @goodman_scenarios_2019 was based. More recent travel data can overcome a major limitation of that study by presenting current transport patterns to school.
-   The travel to school layer in the PCT described by @goodman_scenarios_2019 provided only a single metric for segments on the road network: cycling potential (under a range of scenarios), without reference to key infrastructure datasets that could be vital when prioritising local interventions and identifying where 'pinch points' are in the network.
-   The pandemic has seen an [alarming increase in childhood obesity rates and inequalities](https://twitter.com/TheMooreLab/status/1492883858450169857), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:obesdep). This has pushed active travel for kids up the political agenda.
-   The travel to school layer in the original PCT resulted in a sparse network in some places. This can be overcome using new methods for disaggregating OD pairs to show diffuse residential networks [@lovelace_jittering_2022b].

A broader reason for focussing on cycling potential and infrastructure for young people is that prioritisation of fixing weak links in quiet/beginner networks rather than a 'skeleton' of arterial routes can support more inclusive design.

# Case study: York

In the case study for York below, we use Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) data as the basis of the origin-destination data and the `od2net` package to generate the routes.


```{r}
# We'll start by saving the `zones` data in the `input` folder:
origin_zones = netgen::zones_york
names(origin_zones)
names(origin_zones)[1] = "name"
dir.create("input", showWarnings = FALSE)
sf::write_sf(origin_zones, "input/zones.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

The following code was used to prepare the data with the `od2net` R package (see the paper's [source code](https://github.com/acteng/netgen/blob/main/vignettes/schoolroutes.Rmd) for full reproducible details):

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
od2net::make_osm(zones_file = "input/zones.geojson")
od2net::make_origins()
# Optionally, get elevation data:
# netgen:::make_elevation()
destinations = netgen::destinations_york # Provided in the R package
names(destinations)[1] = "name"
destinations = destinations[1]
class(destinations$name) = "character"
sf::write_sf(destinations, "input/destinations.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

<!-- We'll save the OD dataset in the required format: -->

```{r}
# Save the OD dataset:
od_geo = sf::read_sf("https://github.com/acteng/netgen/releases/download/v0.1.0/res_output.geojson")
od = od_geo |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  transmute(from = O, to = as.character(D), count = round(trips_modelled))
readr::write_csv(od, "input/od.csv", quote = "all")
```

After saving necessary files in the `input` folder, as required by the `od2net` Rust crate, a 'config file' is required to run the model. We used the following configuration options for this case study:

<!-- The `od2net` package requires a configuration file to run. We will use the following configuration file: -->

```{r}
readLines("config_pct_govtarget.json") |> cat(sep = "\n")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
system("od2net config_pct_govtarget.json --rng-seed 42")
```

If the previous lines of code run successfully and you have `od2net` installed, the route network dataset can be generated with the following command, which generates the following message:

```sh
od2net run config_pct_govtarget.json
```

```
Input: Test data for SchoolRoutes project.
- Origins: 19,258
- Destinations: 62
- Requests: 25,515
- Requests (succeeded): 25,364
- Requests (failed because same endpoints): 12
- Requests (failed because no path): 139
- Edges with a count: 37,388
- Total distance on not allowed roads: 2.4 km
- Total distance on LTS 1 roads: 12868.2 km
- Total distance on LTS 2 roads: 18057.4 km
- Total distance on LTS 3 roads: 25217.0 km
- Total distance on LTS 4 roads: 6634.4 km
```

The `od2net` program generates the following files and places them in the `output` folder:

-  `output.geojson`: the route network dataset.
-  `rnet.pmtiles`: a compressed version of the route network dataset for interactive visualisation in web apps.
-  `counts.csv`: a CSV file with the counts of trips on each route segment.
-  `failed_requests.geojson`: a geojson file with the failed requests (i.e. those that could not be routed).

```{r}
#| eval: false
list.files("output")
#> [1] "counts.csv"              "failed_requests.geojson"
#> [3] "output.geojson"          "rnet.pmtiles"
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
file.copy("vignettes/output/output.geojson", "output_pct_govtarget.geojson")
system("gh release upload v0.1.0 output_pct_govtarget.geojson")
# Same with pmtiles:
file.copy("vignettes/output/rnet.pmtiles", "output_pct_govtarget.pmtiles")
system("gh release upload v0.1.0 output_pct_govtarget.pmtiles")
```

The most relevant of these is the 'output.geojson' file, which is also provided as a compressed `pmtiles` file.
You can visualise the results in the web app hosted at [od2net.org](https://od2net.org) by uploading the `output.pmtiles` file, resulting in an interactive map of the routes, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:od2net).

```{r od2net, fig.cap="Routes generated by the SchoolRoutes project."}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("od2net.png")
```

We can also visualise the data with the following code in R:

```{r}
#| echo: false
output_file = "https://github.com/acteng/netgen/releases/download/v0.1.0/output_pct_govtarget.geojson"
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
output_file = "output/output.geojson"
```


```{r rnet-base, include=FALSE}
rnet_govtarget = sf::read_sf(output_file)
rnet_govtarget$length_m = sf::st_length(rnet_govtarget) |> as.numeric()
nrow(rnet_govtarget)
names(rnet_govtarget)
plot(rnet_govtarget["count"], logz = TRUE)
```

The route network object visualised in Figure \@ref(fig:rnet-base) has the following variables:

```
 [1] "backward_cost"     "count"             "destination_count"
 [4] "forward_cost"      "length"            "lts"              
 [7] "nearby_amenities"  "node1"             "node2"            
[10] "origin_count"      "osm_tags"          "way"              
[13] "geometry" 
```

Of these, `count`, `lts`, `osm_tags`, and `way` are the most relevant. Let's take a look at these for a sample of 3 rows (see Table \@ref(tab:rnet-sample)):

```{r rnet-sample}
set.seed(42)
rnet_govtarget |>
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 3) |>
  dplyr::select(count, lts, osm_tags, way, length) |>
  knitr::kable(caption = "Sample of the route network dataset.")
```

As shown above, the `osm_tags` field has all the OSM tags in JSON format, which can be extrated as follows with `jsonlite::fromJSON`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rnet_govtarget$osm_tags[1]
jsonlite::fromJSON(rnet_govtarget$osm_tags[1])
```

<!-- Let's create a minimal version of the dataset for future plots: -->

```{r}
rnet_govtarget_clean = rnet_govtarget |>
  dplyr::transmute(count = as.integer(count), way, lts = as.character(lts), length, osm_tags)
rnet_govtarget_top = rnet_govtarget_clean |>
  dplyr::slice_max(count, n = 5000) |>
  dplyr::arrange(count)
```

The output dataset can be visualised with well-known data science tools, such as the `ggplot2` R package, as follows shown in Figure \@ref(fig:rnet-ggplot), which is generated with the reproducible code below:

```{r rnet-ggplot, fig.cap="Routes with the highest number of trips under the Government Target scenario.", echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(rnet_govtarget_top) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = lts, linewidth = count)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(direction = -1) +
  theme_void()
```

Let's create an interactive map with `tmap`:

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
m = tm_shape(rnet_govtarget_top) +
  tm_lines(col = "count", col.scale = tm_scale(values = "viridis", breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 50, 200)), lwd = 9)
m
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#| label: reprex
remotes::install_github("r-tmap/tmap")
library(tmap)
output_file = "https://github.com/acteng/netgen/releases/download/v0.1.0/output_pct_govtarget.geojson"
rnet_govtarget = sf::read_sf(output_file)
rnet_govtarget_top = rnet_govtarget |>
  dplyr::transmute(count = as.integer(count), way) |>
  dplyr::slice_max(count, n = 5000) |>
  dplyr::arrange(count)
m = tm_shape(rnet_govtarget_top) +
  tm_lines(col = "count", col.scale = tm_scale(values = "viridis", breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 50, 200)), lwd = 9)
m
```

You can save and view the map as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
tmap_save(m, "output_pct_govtarget.html")
browseURL("output_pct_govtarget.html")
system("gh release upload v0.1.0 output_pct_govtarget.html")
```

# Prioritising investment

A simple way to prioritise investment based on the route network outputs shown above is to find the LTS3 and LTS4 roads with the greatest potential.
A key output from the tool will be route network data that contains both the potential number of trips and the LTS classification of each road segment.
Taking a hypothetical scenario in which there is sufficient funding for investment in 5 school streets, targetting the worst (LTS4) roads, the data allows us to identify the roads presented in Table \@ref(tab:rnet-govtarget-top5) and Figure \@ref(fig:rnet-govtarget-top5-map).

```{r rnet-govtarget-top5-map, fig.cap="Top 5 routes with the highest number of trips under the Government Target scenario.", echo=TRUE}
rnet_govtarget_lts4_named = rnet_govtarget_clean |>
  filter(!is.na(osm_tags)) |>
  dplyr::mutate(osm_tags_list = purrr::map(osm_tags, jsonlite::fromJSON)) |>
  # Only keep those with names:
  filter(purrr::map_lgl(osm_tags_list, ~ "name" %in% names(.x))) |>
  dplyr::mutate(name = purrr::map_chr(osm_tags_list, ~ .x$name)) |>
  dplyr::filter(lts %in% c("4")) |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(count))
rnet_govtarget_top_5 = rnet_govtarget_lts4_named |>
  dplyr::group_by(name) |>
  dplyr::summarise(`Total (km)` = sum(count * length) / 1000, .groups = "drop") |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(`Total (km)`)) |>
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5)
m = tm_shape(rnet_govtarget_top_5) +
  tm_lines(
    col = "Total (km)",
    col.scale = tm_scale(values = "viridis", breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 50, 200)),
    lwd = 9
  )
m
```

```{r rnet-govtarget-top5, tab.cap="Top 5 routes with the highest number of trips under the Government Target scenario.", echo=TRUE}
rnet_govtarget_top_5 |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  knitr::kable()
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmap_save(m, "output_pct_govtarget_top5.html")
browseURL("output_pct_govtarget_top5.html")
system("gh release upload v0.1.0 output_pct_govtarget_top5.html")
```

# Sense checking the results

Do the results make sense?
We'll find out by comparing the total number of trips and distance travelled represented in the OD dataset with the output of the model:

```{r}
od_geo$length = sf::st_length(od_geo) |> as.numeric()
sum(od_geo$trips_modelled) # 26k
distance_euclidean_total = sum(od_geo$length * od_geo$trips_modelled)
distance_euclidean_total # 49,000 km
```

Let's do a sense check of the weighted average trip distance:

```{r}
weighted.mean(od_geo$length, od_geo$trips_modelled) # 1.9 km
```

Assuming a trip diversion factor of 1.3 and that 5% of the trips are made by cycling under the Government Target scenario for the short distances travelled to school, we can estimate the total number of trips and distance travelled:

```{r}
total_euclidean_cycled = distance_euclidean_total * 1.3 * 0.05
total_euclidean_cycled # just over 3,000 km
```

The equivalent for the route network output is:

```{r}
rnet_govtarget$length = sf::st_length(rnet_govtarget) |> as.numeric()
total_rnet = sum(rnet_govtarget$count * rnet_govtarget$length, na.rm = TRUE)
round(total_rnet / 1e3) # A bit over 4,000 km
```
